A robot that can answer question, execute task and conduct simple conversation

Inspired by Ironman's Jarvis, I'm attempting to create a somehow alike software. It's of course much less smart or intelligent.

The technology used here is simple. User inputs text command and the software interprets it using NLP toolkit. The output tokens of the NLP toolkit is then translated to a simple formal language to match a relevant module. Then the qualified module executes its program.
